# social-post-magic


Develop a user-friendly Twitter Auto Post Scheduler app that incorporates an intuitive interface with textboxes, preview boxes, buttons, and input fields for URLs. Enhance the app by including a new page called "Settings," allowing users to authenticate their Twitter account and customize various configurations. Utilize the Twitter API for seamless authentication. To ensure a smooth user experience, integrate a reliable database solution like Firebase to store user settings and prevent duplicate tweets. Implement an efficient API call mechanism to generate dynamic post content based on provided topics and URLs. Enhance the app further by integrating image search functionality to find and include relevant images in the generated posts. To accommodate longer text, implement a feature that automatically formats it into tweet threads if it exceeds the character limit. Foster audience growth by incorporating an algorithm that builds an audience based on selected topics. Facilitate navigation between the "Home" and "Settings" pages to enhance user convenience. Finally, package the app as a portable .exe file for easy deployment and usage. Provide comprehensive documentation, including instructions on audience building and manual scheduling.
